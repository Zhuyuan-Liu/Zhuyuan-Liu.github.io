    <h2>Forest Of Theseus</h2>
    <p>“Forest of Theseus” draws inspiration from a famous philosophical paradox from ancient Athens: if every part of a ship is gradually replaced over time, is it still the same ship? If the discarded old parts were reassembled into a new ship, which one would truly be the Ship of Theseus?</p>

    <p>If inorganic matter could grow along the natural trajectory of plant life, and, through programmable robotics and artificial intelligence, establish a wholly new form of symbiosis—could we then define this system as a new kind of lifeform and ecosystem?</p>

    <p>In its early stages, the project went through a period of stylistic and conceptual exploration, aiming to uncover the various possibilities of human habitation within post-industrial ruins.</p>

    <p>The philosophical inquiry of the Ship of Theseus is reimagined through a real site near the estuary in East London, where an abandoned oil refinery sits beside a disused jetty. The project proposes a phased dismantling of the refinery, to be replaced over time by a gradually planted forest.</p>

    <p>Simultaneously, salvaged metal from the demolition will be relocated and installed onto the jetty, forming a "forest of steel" that grows in tandem with the woodland—each mirroring the other.</p>

    <p>Together, they become a cultural park dedicated to environmental awareness and ecological regeneration.</p>
